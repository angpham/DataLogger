 Project 01 - Data Logger
 
When pressing the space key, the button will be automatically pressed and logged as well. This is due to an input complixity issue.  

Resources: I watched all the videos, including the 6 in the "Learning C#" playlist. I also looked at the linked resources on the "Project 01 - Data Logger" Google Doc. From these links, I pressed other recommended links to learn more. For example, I could not figure out how to append to a file, and therefore used this link (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/file-system/how-to-write-to-a-text-file). I wasn't sure how to do it otherwise.
